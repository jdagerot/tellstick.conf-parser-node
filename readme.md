# VERY EARLY WORK

The aim is to read/write the tellstick.conf and maintain an javascript-object in between. To be used by node.js for example. As for now it reads my file fine but it should be rewritten to support multi-level section, if ever that happens.

I haven't read up on what conf-file standard tellstick is using.
